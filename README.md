# Agricultural_Weed_Identification_Using_Optimized_Deep_Learning

The work presented in this research uses state-of-the-art YOLOv7 tiny architecture and integrates two optimization techniques within the backbone and neck components. These two optimization techniques are: (a) module re-parameterized convolutional layer (RCL), and (b) filter-based structured pruning (model compression). Both of these techniques have been adopted from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11904) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02696). For more details read the paper [here]() and browse through the repository to download the trained models along with the architecture. The developed architecture uses 78% less parameters compared to the YOLOv7-Base model.
